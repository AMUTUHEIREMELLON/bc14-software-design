# REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT

# Objective: Development of a Computer manufacturing simulation system.
# Each Development Iteration/Cycle/Sprint Specifys new requirements 
  # to be incrementally added to the computer system.

Sprint_00:
  # Develop code for a computer system with the following features.
    - Should be able to input data from a keyBoard.
    - Should be able to store & retrieve data to & from internal memory.
    - Should be able to process data using the default processing unit.
    - Should be able to output data on a built-in screen.
    - Should be able to connect to WI-FI.
    - Should be able to connect bluetooth device.

Sprint_01:
  # Sprint Goal: Implementing the SOLID Design Principles

  # The Problem:
    # It was discovered that the computer system modeled in the previous iteration was very rigid,
      # In a sense that it does not accomodate variations in;
      # data input devices, Storage devices, Processing devices, and output devices.

    # It was also discovered that the computer system modeled in the previous iteration 
      # forced all computers to support technologies like, WI-Fi, and Bluetooth. 
      # However, due to numerous demands from customers, 
        # the compony now intends to manufacture Computers that do not support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
        # At relatively lower prices than usual.
    
  # Proposal:
    # You are required to re-model the computer system to be able to fullfil the following requirements
    - Should with ease support variation in Input devices used for inputing data.
    - Should with ease support variation in Storage devices used for 
      storing & retrieving data.
    - Should with ease support variation in Processing devices used for processing data.
    - Should with ease support variation in Output devices used for outputing data.
    - The new model should allow for manufacturing of Computers that do not support the WI-FI technology.
    - The new model should allow for manufacturing of Computers that do not support the bluetooth technology.

Sprint_02:
  # Sprint Goal: Implementing the Singleton Design Pattern

  # The Problem:
    # It was identified that with the current design model, none of the manufctured computer is secure.
      # In the recent survey conducted by the Computer Manufacturing company, 
      # it was established that security contributed 99.9 of the features the Computer buyers 
      # would like the compony to mainly focus on.

  # Proposal:
    # The Computer manufacturing Company has proposed adding a new feature to handle 
      # user Authentication, Authorisation, permissions and Security.
    # Below is a list of requirements for the Proposed Feature.

  # Requirements:
    - The New feature (Component) to be added to the computer Model should be called IAMlogger
      # IAM stands for Identification and Authentication Manaagement
    - All Computers to be produced going forward must be secured with the IAMlogger
    - The IAMlogger should allow creation of more that one User Account
    - The IAMlogger should have login and logout provisioned.
    - However, the Strongest condition is,
      The IAMlogger should allow only and only One User at a time to Login and Use the computer.
      I.e. In case of two registered users, UserA and UserB, If userA logs into the copmuter system,
      then UserB can only login into the same Computer 
      after UsserA has successfully logged out of the Computer.
